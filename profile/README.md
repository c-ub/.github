# Kubecub - Join Open Source, Create the Future 🚀

## Why Choose Kubecub? 🤔

Kubecub helps more developers and students join open source and learn about it. We provide mature language frameworks and templates, as well as a mature project specification, community specification, and operation specification. Through Kubecub, you can find more developers and friends with common goals and desires. We review each other's code, share ideas, and implement our own ideas. 😎💡👨‍💻 👩‍💻

You can join the Kubecub community in the following ways:

- Participate in any existing project or feature module of Kubecub for development.
- Create a new repository and make it public in the form of creating value, using our scaffolding, templates, and robot for a better development experience. 🤖
